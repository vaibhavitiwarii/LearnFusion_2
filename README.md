Creating a web scraper in Python involves several steps, including sending HTTP requests to web pages, parsing the HTML content, and extracting the desired information. We'll use the `requests` library for sending HTTP requests and `BeautifulSoup` from the `bs4` library for parsing HTML.

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

First, install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

### Step 2: Sending HTTP Requests

Use the `requests` library to send HTTP requests to the web page you want to scrape.

### Step 3: Parsing HTML with BeautifulSoup

Use `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML content and extract the desired information.

### Step 4: Extracting Data

Extract the desired information from the parsed HTML. For example, to extract all the headings from a web page:

### Notes:
- Be mindful of the website's `robots.txt` file and terms of service, which specify the rules for web scraping.
- Use delays and respect the website's request limits to avoid overloading the server.
- For more advanced web scraping, consider handling JavaScript-rendered content with tools like Selenium or Playwright.
